<h1> Classification of Violent Crime Prediction in Global Communities </h1>

This project aims to predict violent crimes in global communities using machine learning classification models. The goal is to identify patterns and trends in the occurrence of violent crimes and predict their likelihood in different communities.

## Data

We used the Communities and Crime Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, which includes information on crime rates and socio-economic characteristics of various communities. The dataset contains 2215 instances and 128 attributes.

## Steps

The following steps will be taken in this project:

1) <b>Objective Definition:</b> The first step is to define the objectives of the project. The objectives of this project are to identify patterns and trends in crime data, develop a model to classify crimes or predict crime rates in neighborhoods, and use the findings from the analysis to develop recommendations for reducing crime and improving community safety.
2) <b>Data Collection</b>
3) <b>Data Exploration</b>
4) <b>Data Cleaning</b>
5) <b>Data Preprocessing</b>
6) <b>Dimension Reduction</b>
7) <b>Task Specification and Model Selection</b>
8) <b>Data Partition</b>
9) <b>Model Training</b>
10) <b>Performance Evaluation</b>

## Models

We experimented with the following five classification models in this project:

Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Decision Tree
Random Forest
Gaussian Naive Bayes

## Usage

To run this project, you can clone this repository and run the main.ipynb notebook file in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment. You will need to install the required libraries such as scikit-learn, numpy, and pandas.

## Conclusion

The classification models used in this project can help predict the occurrence of violent crimes in different communities, which can be useful for law enforcement agencies to take preventive measures. Further analysis can be done to identify the factors that contribute to the occurrence of violent crimes and to develop targeted interventions to reduce them.
